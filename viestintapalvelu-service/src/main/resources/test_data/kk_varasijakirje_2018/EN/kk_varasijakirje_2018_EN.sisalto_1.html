<h2>Conditional acceptance</h2>
<p>According to the study programme's admission criteria, your admission result may be conditional. Conditional
    acceptance is based on a degree with a certificate that cannot yet be obtained or on information you have provided
    and which will be checked later (for example, in admission to universities of applied sciences, general upper
    secondary school certificates or vocational upper secondary school certificates and higher education degree
    certificates as well as possible employment certificates). A conditional acceptance will be cancelled, if the higher
    education institution has not received copies of the required document(s) by the deadline. Please check the deadline
    from the admission criteria. A conditional acceptance may also be cancelled, if it has been made based on
    unconfirmed, predicted grades should the final grades be lower. If the information you have provided proves
    incorrect, your study place may be cancelled. The admission result may also be conditional if you are required to
    pay a tuition fee. You can check this from the higher education institution.</p>

<h2>Appeals</h2>
<p>If you believe there has been a mistake in the student selection and the admission criteria have not been applied
    correctly, you can make a written request for rectification within 14 days after the student selection results have
    been published before the closing time of the higher education institution. Always check the admission criteria of
    the study programme and the instructions regarding rectifications first. If necessary, you can then contact the
    higher education institution in question. You can make a written, individualized request for rectification by the
    deadline mentioned above. More detailed information about making a request for rectification and contact information
    can be found on the website and in the application material of the higher education institution in question. The
    higher education institution will not process a request for rectification if it concerns a study option that you
    have placed lower on your application than the one you have been accepted to.</p>
<p>The request for rectification must be addressed to a recipient defined by the higher education institution and must
    be submitted to the address stated in the admission criteria by the deadline mentioned above.</p>
