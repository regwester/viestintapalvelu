Unfortunately you have     not been accepted to the study programmes you applied to. On the second page of this letter you can find information     about the situation of your study options in the student selection. If you have been placed on the waiting list for     any of your study options, you can still be accepted to one of them if a place becomes available. The places that     become available will be filled according to the reserve place order. You will be contacted by email, if you are     accepted to a study place from the waiting list. Admissions from the waiting list end on 18 December 2018 at 3 pm at     the latest. You can also see your waiting list situation from the My Studyinfo -service. In order to log in to the     service you will need Finnish online banking credentials, a mobile certificate or a smart ID card and reader.</p>  <p>If the selection result for a study option is \"failed\" or \"cancelled\", you cannot be admitted from the waiting     list.</p>  <p>The admission criteria of each higher education institution are applied in the student selection process.

Always check the admission criteria of the study programme and the instructions regarding rectifications first. If     necessary, you can then contact the higher education institution in question. You can make a written, individualized     request for rectification by the deadline mentioned above. More detailed information about making a request for     rectification and contact information can be found on the website and in the application material of the higher     education institution in question. The request for rectification must be addressed to a recipient defined by the     higher education institution and must be submitted to the address stated in the admission criteria by the deadline     mentioned above.</p>  <p>If you were not accepted to any of your study options, you can look into the following options:</p>  <h2>Supplementary application round</h2> <p>Some higher education institutions arrange their own supplementary application rounds, if all study places are not     filled in the spring joint application. Possible supplementary application rounds take place between 3 December and      14 December 2018. Check the exact dates for each possible supplementary application round from Studyinfo.fi.</p>  <h2>Open studies</h2> <p>Both open university and open university of applied sciences offer open studies according to the higher education     institution’s own curriculum. These studies are open for anyone and can contribute towards a degree, if you apply to     study for a degree later. The studies will also give you an idea of what studying the field you are interested in is     like and what it requires. You can find more information about open studies from each higher education institution’s     own website and from Studyinfo.fi.</p>  <h2>Autumn joint application</h2> <p>The next joint application to higher education starts on 9 January and ends 23 January 2019 at Studyinfo.fi.

For example,                     a failed language test or one failed section of the entrance examination may prevent the selection                     despite the total                     score. You can see the score only if it is possible to count the points for you according to this                     selection method.                     The column is empty if there are no points given in the selection method or if it is not possible to                     count your                     points.                 </dd>                 <dt>                     Your reserve place status                 </dt>                 <dd>                     Here you can see your reserve place status if you have been placed on a waiting                     list. It is possible that you have been placed on a waiting list in several queues in the same study                     programme. The                     selection methods are applied according to the higher education institution’s admission criteria.                     You can find more                     detailed information on the selection methods from the admission criteria of the study programme in                     question.                 </dd>                 <dt>                     Accepted (conditional)                 </dt>                 <dd>                     This admission result means that the admission decision is conditional and will be                     confirmed only after you have proven to the higher education institution that the condition has been                     met.                     Universities of applied sciences also use the term \"Accepted\" for conditional acceptance.                 </dd>             </dl>             <p>If you need help with interpreting the selection results or if you need more detailed information about                 the basis for                 rejection, you can contact the admission services of the higher education institution in question.</p>         </section>     </article> </main>  </body>  </html> "}]},{"type":"letter","styleName":"kk_jalkiohjauskirje_tyyli","style":"@page {   size: 210mm 297mm;
